'''
    This is a small backend server in Python using Flask paired with a Flutter app.
    The small project is about sending and receiving files encoded in base64 while implementing a good CORS policy in this backend server.
    CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) policy is a mechanism that uses HTTP headers to check
    if a server allows to share files outside of a given domain (cross-origin). This allows a very controlled environment
    when sharing resources with other domains to prevent potential information leakage or attacks.

    CORS process:
        1. Before the domain asks for a resource, the browser that is being used sends a CORS preflight request before the actual request.
        This CORS preflight request gives small information of the actual request (like method, etc.)
        to the server before its executed in its totality.
        This gives the server an opportunity to check what operations will be done and if it either allow it or tell the browser show an error to the client.
        2. Send actual request if the CORS preflight allows the request to be sent.
